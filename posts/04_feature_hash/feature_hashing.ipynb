    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how seemingly unrelated topics such as pigeons, birthdays, and collisions possibly share a connection? At first glance, they appear to belong to entirely different worlds. Pigeons are birds, birthdays are personal milestones, and collisions are unfortunatly a common sight in modern day traffic. Yet, beneath the surface, these concepts are tied together in a quirky way in how things fit into spaces that are too small to contain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle isn’t just an observation; it’s a building block of mathematics. It explains why, in a room of just 23 people, there’s a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday 🎂. It reveals why cramming too many pigeons into too few holes guarantees some are going to share a pigeon hole. \n",
    "\n",
    "And it underpins a challenge in machine learning: how to efficiently map vast amounts of data into a manageable space without everything colliding into a mess."

    "# The Pigeonhole Principle and the Birthday Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pigeonhole Principle: When Space Runs Out\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a pigeon keeper you have a 9 spaces for pigeons to nest in, and you have 3 birds. no problem what so ever. There is space for all the birds. \n",
    "\n",
    "![enough space for all the birds, nobody has to share a hole](artifacts/birds_green.jpg \"3 birds fit into 9 holes, no problem\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you have 10 birds, we only have 9 holes. No matter how hard you try, at least one of those holes *must* end up with more than one pigeon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![no enogh space for all the birds, at least one hole must have more than one bird](artifacts/birds_red.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the [Wikipedia: Pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle), one of the simplest ideas in mathematics. if we have $n$ items and $m$ containers, at least one container must hold more than $n$  items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s an obvious idea, but its implications are widely applicable. Whether you’re stuffing pigeons into holes, assigning students to classrooms, or mapping data to storage bins,  **when you force too many things into too little space, collisions are inevitable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Birthday Paradox: A Surprising Twist\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s trade pigeons for people and holes for birthdays. You’re at a party with 23 guests, and someone asks: \"What’s the chance that two people here share the same birthday?\" Most people guess the odds are low—after all, there are 365 possible birthdays, so surely 23 people wouldn’t be enough to guarantee a match, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The birthday paradox reveals that there’s actually a 50% chance two people in that room share a birthday with only 23 people. By the time you reach 70 people, the probability skyrockets to 99.9%. How is this possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:72px;\">🎂➡️📅</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key lies in **shifting perspective**. Most of us instinctively think about the odds of someone else sharing our birthday. That is unlikely—just a 6% chance with 23 people. But the birthday paradox isn’t about matching your birthday. It’s about any two people in the room matching each other. Suddenly, the math flips, and collisions become not just likely but guaranteed as the group grows. We are stuffing pigeons into holes again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting the Dots: Why These Ideas Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the pigeonhole principle and the birthday paradox seem like unrelated curiosities. One is about cramming pigeons into holes; the other is about people sharing birthdays. But strip away the context, and you’ll find they’re two sides of the same coin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pigeonhole Principle**: \"If you have more items than containers, collisions are guaranteed.\"\n",
    "- **Birthday Paradox**: \"Even with far fewer items than containers, collisions become likely faster than you’d expect.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both principles expose the same truth: when you map a large set to a smaller space, overlaps are inevitable. The pigeonhole principle proves it’s certain with enough items, while the birthday paradox shows it happens earlier than intuition suggests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s zoom in on the math behind the birthday paradox to see just how quickly collisions can sneak up on you.\n",

    "# Hashing Basics: When Data Runs Out of Room\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Pigeons to Data: The Birth of Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve seen how the pigeonhole principle and the birthday paradox reveal a fundamental truth: when you try to fit too many things into too little space, collisions are inevitable. But what does this have to do with computers and data? Enter hashing, a concept that takes the pigeonhole principle and applies it to the digital world.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, hashing is a way to take a large, unwieldy piece of data—like a pdf, a photo, or even an entire book and map it to a smaller, fixed-size value, called a hash which is similar to the fingerprint of humans. Each and every one of the, is unique and them are about the same size. the fixed-size value of the hash can be tought of like a pigeon hole, and the data we want to hash is the pigeon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Hashing Works: The Magic Black Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions are like black boxes. You toss something in—whether it’s a PDF, a photo, a book, or even a single word—and out pops a fixed-length string of seemingly random characters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: `\"hello\"` → Output: `\"4acdf636-caee-88b8-ad0e-cb17fe41d7f7\"`\n",
    "- Input: `The entire text of \"Dune: Messiah\"` → Output: `\"d52492b0-440d-88c5-af3a-cce3d3afeb00\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what you feed into a hash function, the output is always the same length. It’s like a digital fingerprint: unique (in theory) and compact. But here’s the catch: the number of possible outputs isn’t infinite/ $\\infty$. Just like the pigeonhole principle, if you have more inputs than possible outputs, collisions can and will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Collisions Are Inevitable\n",
    "Hash functions map an infinite (or near-infinite) number of possible inputs to a finite number of outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- A hash function that outputs 64-bit hashes has $2^{64}$ possible outputs.\n",
    "- A hash function that outputs 256-bit hashes has $2^{256}$ possible outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no matter how large the output space, it’s still finite. And if you have enough inputs, collisions will occur—just like cramming too many pigeons into too few holes. The birthday paradox tells us that collisions happen way sooner than you’d expect, too."
