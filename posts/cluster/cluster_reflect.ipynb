    "\n",
    "As the owners of a thriving supermarket mall, you seek a deeper understanding of your customer base. Data points including demographics, spending habits, and loyalty program membership details are at your disposal. Your goal is to identify distinct groups within your customers to tailor marketing initiatives, thereby maximizing the efficiency of your promotional efforts.\n",

    "To achieve this, you opt for clustering algorithms to group similar customers based on characteristics and behaviors. By isolating specific segments of your customer base, you aim to tailor marketing strategies to respective subgroups, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome and resulting in maximizing the bang for your marketing buck.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this initial stage, the goal is to prepare the data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data by removing or filling in missing values, which could be done through various strategies like dropping the missing rows, filling them with mean/median/mode, or using a prediction model. It's also crucial to handle outliers and potentially normalize features if they're on different scales. This stage might also involve dealing with categorical variables using encoding techniques. Effective preprocessing is crucial for reliable results in the subsequent stages.\n",

    "So, upon taking a look at the dataset, it seems like we've got a mix of numeric and non-numeric columns. Specifically, the `gender` column is the only non-numeric feature - it's all categorical data, with customers labeled as either \"Male\" or \"Female\". All the other columns - `id`, `age`, `income`, and `spending` - are numeric data types.\n",

Otherwise, the algorithm will group together instances based on the features with the highest numbers, rather than looking at all the features. That'd be like trying to compare apples and oranges!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to process the `gender` column by encoding those categories as numbers. One common way to do this is to map \"Male\" and \"Female\" to 1 and 0, respectively. Once we've done that, gender will be represented numerically like the other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, we need to encode the gender categorical data, exclude the customer `id` column, and normalize the remaining columns before we can apply clustering algorithms. Luckily for us, there are no NULL values in the data, so we don't have to worry about dealing with those. Easy peasy!\n"
