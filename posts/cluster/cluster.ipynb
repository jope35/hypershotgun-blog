    "when using distance-based clustering algorithms like K-Means, it's essential to ensure that all features are on a comparable scale to avoid the algorithm being influenced disproportionately by one feature with larger values. The Yeo-Johnson power transformation is a popular method for normalizing data distribution, especially when dealing with skewed data like in our case. This transformation can help bring our income/spending ratio data closer to a more normal distribution, making it easier for clustering algorithms to identify meaningful patterns across all features. In the right plot, you can see how the [yeo-johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform#Yeo%E2%80%93Johnson_transformation) power transformation has helped to make the feature behave much more similarly to a normally distributed one, which will be beneficial when applying distance-based clustering algorithms. By ensuring that all features are on a comparable scale, we can effectively capture the relationships between income, spending, and potentially other demographic variables to discover meaningful patterns in our dataset."

    "In the EDA phase, we've observed a connection between age and spending/income. However, what constitutes high spending for a 20-year-old isn't the same as for a 60-year-old. To account for this, I've grouped ages into bins and calculated the difference between each bin's mean value and individual observations. The result is a number that shows whether someone spends more or less than average for their age bracket. Similarly, I applied this methodology to gender as well."
