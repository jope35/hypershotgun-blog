    "1. Be wary of functions that grow too large. As a general rule, a file\n",
    "    should not be over 250 lines, and a function should not be over 70 lines.\n",
    "2. Try to keep your code in logical blocks. For example, if you have\n",
    "    multiple lines referencing the same things, try to keep them\n",
    "    together. Separating them reduces context and readability.\n",
    "3. Test your code! If you *can* run the local tests, do so and make\n",
    "    sure that your new code is covered by the tests. If you can't run\n",
    "    the local tests, build the datasets on your branch and manually\n",
    "    verify that the data looks as expected.\n",
    "4. Avoid `.otherwise(value)` as a general fallback. If you are mapping\n",
    "    a list of keys to a list of values and a number of unknown keys appear,\n",
    "    using `otherwise` will mask all of these into one value.\n",
    "5. Do not keep commented out code checked in the repository. This applies\n",
    "    to single line of codes, functions, classes or modules. Rely on git\n",
    "    and its capabilities of branching or looking at history instead.\n",
    "6. When encountering a large single transformation composed of integrating multiple different source tables, split it into the natural sub-steps and extract the logic to functions. This allows for easier higher level readability and allows for code re-usability and consistency between transforms.\n",
    "7. Try to be as explicit and descriptive as possible when naming functions\n",
    "    or variables. Strive to capture what the function is actually doing\n",
    "    as opposed to naming it based the objects used inside of it.\n",
    "8. Think twice about introducing new import aliases, unless there is a good\n",
    "    reason to do so. Some of the established ones are `types` and `functions` from PySpark `from pyspark.sql import types as T, functions as F`.\n",
    "9. Avoid using literal strings or integers in filtering conditions, new\n",
    "    values of columns etc. Instead, to capture their meaning, extract them into variables, constants,\n",
    "    dicts or classes as suitable. This makes the\n",
    "    code more readable and enforces consistency across the repository.\n",
