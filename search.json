    "text": "2 Introduction\nLinear regression is a statistical model that can be used to determine the linear relationship between variables, most of the time this is seen as a beginners model that is not particularly useful, and most of the time it is discarded and replaced by a shiny neural net or a fancy gradient-boosted model.\nthe nice feature of linear regression is that the direction and magnitude of the relationship can be estimated with the help of linear regression. It is used in many fields including but not limited to Economics, Finance, Social science, etc. The popularity of this model is model is likely due to the fact that most systems have built-in functionality that enables the training of linear models, they are also very cheap/fast to train, and one can also determine that the model has optimal parameters. all these features make linear regression an excellent model to start with.\nTo extend the capabilities of the linear model for time series forecasting, dummy variables can be utilized. These dummies can provide additional information about the relationship over time, can help the model to identify seasonality over time, and also gauge the effect of one-off events, examples are price reductions or natural disasters.\nFor instance, we can create a dummy to identify certain datetime features such as what the month is or whether a particular day is a weekday or a weekend."

I have selected this one because, in the prophet documentation, this dataset is used in the section “Seasonality, Holiday Effects, And Regressors” so it seems fitting to use it, to demonstrate the usefulness of seasonal dummies. The prophet docs describes the dataset in the following way:\n\nAs an example, let’s look at a time series of the log daily page views for the Wikipedia page for Peyton Manning. We scraped this data using the Wikipedia trend package in R. Peyton Manning provides a nice example because it illustrates some of Prophet’s features, like multiple seasonality, changing growth rates, and the ability to model special days (such as Manning’s playoff and Superbowl appearances).\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_in = pd.read_csv(\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/prophet/main/examples/example_wp_log_peyton_manning.csv\"\n)\ndf_in = df_in.assign(ds=pd.to_datetime(df_in[\"ds\"]))\ndf_in = df_in[(df_in[\"ds\"] > \"2012\")]  # selecting data after 2012\n\n\nIt is always nice to see what we are working with so let us plot the data over time to see what we visually can extract from the plot. we are looking for patterns over time and other behavior and/or pattern that we can exploit.\n\n\nCode\nplt.plot_date(\n    x=df_in[\"ds\"],\n    y=df_in[\"y\"],\n    label=\"input timeseries\",\n    fmt=\"-\",\n)\nplt.tick_params(axis=\"x\", rotation=45)\nplt.ylabel(\"target variable - $y$\")\nplt.title(\"daily visits ot Peyton Manning wiki on a daily basis (log)\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nI have selected data from 2012 onwards, this should be enough to test drive the seasonal dummies. The first thing that I notice is that there is a dip around months 06 and 07. In early August teams play so exhibition games before the start of the actual season.\nAlso, we can observe a pattern over the year, it starts high then dips, and then and high again. This can be seen for the other years as well, so there is some repeating seasonality. Let us continue and train our first models. Starting with a simple ordinary linear regression and then adding dummies to see if they improve the performance of the model."
