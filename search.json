    "text": "2 Data Preprocessing\nIn this initial stage, the goal is to prepare the data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data by removing or filling in missing values, which could be done through various strategies like dropping the missing rows, filling them with mean/median/mode, or using a prediction model. It’s also crucial to handle outliers and potentially normalize features if they’re on different scales. This stage might also involve dealing with categorical variables using encoding techniques.

Specifically, it contains string values categorizing customers as either “Male” or “Female”. All other columns - ‘id’, ‘age’, ‘income’, and ‘spending’ - are numeric data types.\nThe ‘id’ column seems to be a unique identifier for each customer. While numeric, this feature has very high cardinality (a distinct value for every customer). Features with high cardinality tend to dominate distance calculations in clustering algorithms and obscure more meaningful patterns in the data. Therefore, we should exclude the customer ID column from the feature set used for clustering.\nFor the remaining features to function effectively in clustering algorithms, the input features generally need to be numeric rather than categorical strings. Distance-based algorithms like k-means rely on computing distances between data points across features. String categories do not have an inherent numeric ordering, so the distance computations would not be meaningful.\nAdditionally, when performing exploratory analysis, a numeric encoding often allows easier visualization of the impact of gender relative to the other numeric features. Box plots, scatter plots with color-coded points, and other techniques can provide better insights into how gender correlates with shopper age, income or spending habits when mapped to a numeric form.\nTherefore, to enable the application of clustering algorithms and more impactful analysis, we need to process the ‘gender’ column by encoding the categories as numbers. Common encoding schemes include mapping “Male” and “Female” to 0 and 1 respectively, or using one-hot encoding to create an additional binary feature column for each category. After encoding, gender will be represented numerically like the other existing features.\nIn summary, as gender is the only non-numeric column, and ID has high cardinality unsuitable for clustering, effectively preparing the data requires encoding the gender categorical data and excluding the customer ID column.\n\n\nCode\n# convert gender to a numerical value via one-hot-encoding\n# clustering models usally need numerical values\ndf_mall = pd.get_dummies(df_mall, columns=[\"gender\"], drop_first=True)\n\n# list with features for easy reference\nfeatures = [\"age\", \"income\", \"spending\", \"gender_male\"]\ndf_feature = df_mall[features]\n\n\n# look at a random sample to validate the contents\ndf_feature.sample(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\nincome\nspending\ngender_male\n\n\n\n\n109\n66\n63\n48\nTrue\n\n\n132\n25\n72\n34\nFalse\n\n\n66\n43\n48\n50\nFalse\n\n\n41\n24\n38\n92\nTrue\n\n\n135\n29\n73\n88\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_feature.info()\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 200 entries, 0 to 199\nData columns (total 4 columns):\n #   Column       Non-Null Count  Dtype\n---  ------       --------------  -----\n 0   age          200 non-null    int64\n 1   income       200 non-null    int64\n 2   spending     200 non-null    int64\n 3   gender_male  200 non-null    bool \ndtypes: bool(1), int64(3)\nmemory usage: 5.0 KB"

    "text": "2 Introduction\nLinear regression is a statistical model that can be used to determine the linear relationship between variables, most of the time this is seen as a beginners model that is not particularly useful, and most of the time it is discarded and replaced by a shiny neural net or a fancy gradient-boosted model.\nthe nice feature of linear regression is that the direction and magnitude of the relationship can be estimated with the help of linear regression. It is used in many fields including but not limited to Economics, Finance, Social science, etc. The popularity of this model is model is likely due to the fact that most systems have built-in functionality that enables the training of linear models, they are also very cheap/fast to train, and one can also determine that the model has optimal parameters. all these features make linear regression an excellent model to start with.\nTo extend the capabilities of the linear model for time series forecasting, dummy variables can be utilized. These dummies can provide additional information about the relationship over time, can help the model to identify seasonality over time, and also gauge the effect of one-off events, examples are price reductions or natural disasters.\nFor instance, we can create a dummy to identify certain datetime features such as what the month is or whether a particular day is a weekday or a weekend."

    "text": "4 Reading in the data\nFor this example, we will be using a dataset form the prophet package. I have selected this one because, in the prophet documentation, this dataset is used in the section “Seasonality, Holiday Effects, And Regressors” so it seems fitting to use it, to demonstrate the usefulness of seasonal dummies. The prophet docs describes the dataset in the following way:\n\nAs an example, let’s look at a time series of the log daily page views for the Wikipedia page for Peyton Manning. We scraped this data using the Wikipedia trend package in R. Peyton Manning provides a nice example because it illustrates some of Prophet’s features, like multiple seasonality, changing growth rates, and the ability to model special days (such as Manning’s playoff and Superbowl appearances).\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_in = pd.read_csv(\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/prophet/main/examples/example_wp_log_peyton_manning.csv\"\n)\ndf_in = df_in.assign(ds=pd.to_datetime(df_in[\"ds\"]))\ndf_in = df_in[(df_in[\"ds\"] &gt; \"2012\")]  # selecting data after 2012\n\n\nIt is always nice to see what we are working with so let us plot the data over time to see what we visually can extract from the plot. we are looking for patterns over time and other behavior and/or pattern that we can exploit.\n\n\nCode\nplt.plot_date(\n    x=df_in[\"ds\"],\n    y=df_in[\"y\"],\n    label=\"input timeseries\",\n    fmt=\"-\",\n)\nplt.tick_params(axis=\"x\", rotation=45)\nplt.ylabel(\"target variable - $y$\")\nplt.title(\"daily visits ot Peyton Manning wiki on a daily basis (log)\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have selected data from 2012 onwards, this should be enough to test drive the seasonal dummies. The first thing that I notice is that there is a dip around months 06 and 07. In early August teams play so exhibition games before the start of the actual season.\nAlso, we can observe a pattern over the year, it starts high then dips, and then and high again. This can be seen for the other years as well, so there is some repeating seasonality. Let us continue and train our first models. Starting with a simple ordinary linear regression and then adding dummies to see if they improve the performance of the model."
